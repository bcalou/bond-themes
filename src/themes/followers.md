title: Followers Theme

comment: "
<p>According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Jack Lord did not return as Felix Leiter in <cite>Goldfinger</cite> because he demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money.</p>

<p>If that's true, Lord's ego would have been very satisfied by the fact that Felix almost had his own theme, something that never happened in any other movie. Almost, because it would be a bit far-fetched to actually assign this theme to Felix.</p>

<p>This suspensful bit of music is played only twice and is tightly associated to the idea of Bond being followed by a mysterious stranger. It stops appearing after the friendly identity of Felix is revealed.</p>

<p>The theme is comprised of two parts: a tense introduction and a simple melody line.</p>

<h2>a. Introduction</h2>

<p>The introduction is a four-note phrase that is played two times:</p>
<abc-track id='followers_intro' abc='[M:4/4] [K:C#m] [Q:1/4=80] [L:1/16] eee | c12-ceee | c16'></abc-track>

<p>In the movie, it perfectly synchronizes with the revelation that Bond is followed (at the airport) or has been followed and has a gun in his back (at Pussfella's club).</p>

<p>Now let's play with this a bit. There are only two different notes here, forming a descending minor third (three semi-tones from E to C#).</p>

<abc-track id='followers_intro' abc='[K:C#m] [Q:1/4=80] [L:1/16] \"E\"eee | \"C#\"c16'></abc-track>

<p>What whould happen if we kept the rythm but played the notes in the reversed order? We'd now have an ascending minor third:</p>

<abc-track abc='[K:C#m] [Q:1/4=80] [L:1/16] \"C#\"c\"E\"eee8'></abc-track>

Let's continue and transpose this, starting with a low E:
<abc-track abc='[K:Em] [V:1 clef=treble-8] [Q:1/4=80] [L:1/16] \"E\"E\"G\"GGG8'></abc-track>

<p>This ascending minor third with the third repeating itself is very evocative of the James Bond Theme's guitar riff, which goes from the tonic to the minor third (see the annotated part):</p>

<abc-track abc='[M:4/4] [K:Em] [V:1 clef=treble-8] [Q:1/4=142] EF/2F/2FF2EEE | \"E\"E\"G\"G/2G/2GG2'></abc-track>

<p>This minor third also opens the swing part:</p>

<abc-track abc='[M:4/4] [K:Em] [V:1 clef=treble-8] [Q:1/4=142] \"E\"E\"G\"G2^d=d3G | ^AB-B4' swing></abc-track>

<p>There are other occurences of this minor third in the James Bond Theme, and it is an important part of Bond's musical identity. A last example is E and G being the two lowest notes of the \"James Bond chord\".</p>

<abc-track abc='[K:Em] [V:1 clef=treble-8] [L:1/2] \"E\"E\"G\"G\"EmM9\"[EGB^df]2'></abc-track>

<p>Now, I don't personnaly think that Norman referenced that on purpose in such a secondary theme (calling it a theme is already bold). But as he was working on establishing the Bond sound, it is possible that the \"Bond minor third\" found its way outside of the main theme, unbeknownst to its composer…</p>

<h2>b. Melody</h2>

Let's move on to the second part of this theme, which is a simple descending melody:
<abc-track abc='[M:4/4] [L:1/4] [K:C#] [Q:1/4=80] c2=dc | B=AFE- | E3'></abc-track>

<p>Does that sound familiar? It may, because it uses the same rare and specific scale than <a href=''>Dr. No's theme</a>: the double harmonic major scale. More than that, if we exclude the first note, it's a simple walk down of the scale, with the fifth left out, like in the doctor's theme. Striking coincidence.</p>

<p>Here is the full scale (descending):</p>

<abc-track abc='[L:1/4] [K:C#] [Q:1/4=80] cB=AGFE=DC'></abc-track>

From this scale is derived the descending part of Dr. No's theme (here transposed to C♯ major to fit the followers theme):
<abc-track abc='[M:4/4] [K:C#] [L:1/4] [Q:1/4=80] =dc=AF | =D4'></abc-track>

<p>This sounds a lot like the melody of the followers theme. Once again, I would not place my bet on Norman doing this on purpose. I think this scale sounded mysterious to him and that he used it more or less unconsciously in several places. We'll never know.</p>

<p>Still, it's funny to see how such a minor theme can be connected to the rest of the score without too much difficulty.</p>
