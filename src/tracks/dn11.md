comment: "
<p>As Felix Leiter surprises Bond with a gun in his back, we hear the second and last rendition of the followers theme:</p>
<abc-track abc='[M:4/4] [K:C#m] [Q:1/4=80] [L:1/16] eee | c12-ceee | c16'></abc-track>

<p>The track goes on, and the introduction is played again, but this time in A minor:</p>
<abc-track abc='[M:4/4] [K:Am] [Q:1/4=80] [L:1/16] ccc | A12-Accc | A16'></abc-track>

<p>Finally, as Felix is revealed to be with the good guys, the introduction is repeated one last time, yet in another key (Gâ™¯ minor). This time, it uses triplets (which make the motif slower) and a much softer instrumentation, illustrating the threat slowly becoming a friendly presence.</p>
<abc-track abc='[M:4/4] [K:G#m] [Q:1/4=80] (3BBB | G6(3BBB | G8'></abc-track>"
