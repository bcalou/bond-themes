comment: "<p>I don't mind for some bongos, but right after the <cite>James Bond Theme</cite>, this is quite a dramatic tone shift we get here.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of this track is seemingly to introduce the audience to Jamaica, along with the dancers on the screen, and probably to smoothen the transition between the <cite>James Bond Theme</cite> and <cite>Three Blind Mice</cite>.</p>"

trivia: "<p>At 2:08 in the movie, you can clearly hear a sound editing mistake. <cite>Three Blind Mice</cite> starts over the bongos then immediatly stops. It comes back for good, 10 seconds after this false start. You can't unhear it.</p>"
