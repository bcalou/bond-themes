comment: "<p>A brutal gunshot has interrupted Daphne Oram's strange electronic sounds. The audience's blood is pumping. What on earth could follow that? It is, of course, the <cite>James Bond Theme</cite>, with a very bold editing choice from Maurice Binder, the opening sequence designer.</p>
<p>Instead of starting as recorded, with the sneaky bass line, the theme starts directly from the most intense part of the track, the swing. And it doesn't even start from the beginning of the swing, it skips directly to the second time it's played, when the instrumentation is at its heaviest. Bang!</p>
<p>This is totally unorthodox, as the theme has no time to build-up, but super effective at creating one of the most intense opening in cinema history. It screams <q>James Bond is here, hang on for the ride !</q> Along with the gunshot, the blood and the flashy colors, that's just pure visual and sonic excitment.</p>
<p>From here, the theme plays almost through the end. But after the rising coda, it skips the famous final Bond chord and goes back to the guitar riff that opens the original recording. And that's how the James Bond Theme is almost played in its entirety, albeit in a totally different order from what was intended.</p>"


trivia: "<p>At first, Monty Norman was not pleased at all with the heavy editing of his theme: <q>I had a small row with Binder actually. I wanted the theme to be done exactly as is â€” from beginning to end [...]. But he started moving it. I said \"You're ruining it, you're absolutly ruinuing it.\" I sent him a couple of letters and I protested to Harry and Cubby about it. But you know, they were right.</q></p>"
