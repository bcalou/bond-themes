from: 00:00:10
to: 00:00:27

composer: Daphne Oram

released_details: The <a href="http://daphneoram.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/oramcollection.htm">Daphne Oram archives</a> mention a 6'28" track labelled "Atoms in Space Master Copy Dr No July 1962", but it is nowhere to be found online. The archive seems to be accessible by appointment only at Goldsmiths, University of London. As for what we hear in the movie, the gunshot cannot be separated from the track.

interest: HIGH

comment: "<p>The first Bond composer is a woman. Daphne Oram is, to this day, the only woman to have composed instrumental music used in a Bond movie. 17 seconds of music, to be precise, but what an entrance for 007!</p><p>That a movie with an otherwise very old-school score should open with <i lang=\"fr\">musique concr√®te</i>, a genre in which Oram was a pionner, is a perfect illustration of <cite>Dr. No</cite>'s musical paradoxes.</p><p>Maurice Binder, who was working on the equally experimental opening titles, can be thanked for his intuition : <q>The film itself had Dr. No working with computers to topple the rocket. I thought we should have computer sounds on the titles. I looked for where I could get the sound effects and they said there was this little old lady in Surrey who had been doing experiments with electronic sound. She sent me a couple of selections.</q> (<cite>Some King of Hero</cite>, Matthew Field & Ajay Chowdhury).</p>
<p>Sadly, Daphne Oram was not credited in the movie, but she gave to the franchise one of its most innovative musical moments.</p>"

trivia: <p>This is not Oram's only contribution to the movie. She also provided electronic sound effects that were used when Bond escapes through the pipes of Dr. No's lair and in the control room. Combined with the sets of the visionnary Ken Adam, these innovative sounds add a lot of atmosphere to these scenes.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.daphneoram.org/aboutoram/">Daphne Oram website</a> mentions that <q>these sounds were used by the James Bond films up until <cite>Goldfinger</cite></q>, but it seems impossible to know to what extent. So I'll just assume every blip and blop from the first three movies is her's. She rocks.</p>
